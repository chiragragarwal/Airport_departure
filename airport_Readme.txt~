Problem	: The airport departure system

I have a "mega" folder, which has the following files
	- airport.c ==> It is the main driver file for the system. It further forks all other process.
	- INPUT.txt ==> It is the input file.
	- VARIABLES.h ==> It has the entire struct definition and the declaration of all the global variables
						such as the process IDs of all the processes. It also declares the function "takeInputs()" which 
						takes input from the "INPUT.txt" file
	- variables.c ==> It has the "takeInputs()" function definition and includes the VARIABLES.h file.
	- Makefile
	
This "mega" folder has subfolders for every new sub-process as follows :

1) baggage : It has the file bag_new.c for the 'Baggage_Counter' process and subfolders for it's subprocesses.
   It's subdirectories are as follows:
 		> luggage_security : 
 			--> LUGGAGE.h ==> It performs the tasks for luggage_security process
 			--> COLOR.h   ==> To check if a number is colorful or not
 			--> PALINDROME.h ==> To check if a number is a palindrome or not
 			--> SEARCH_DELETE2D.h ==> To delete liquid and explosive elements from the luggage i.e a 2D array.
 			
 		> weight :
 			--> WEIGHT.h ==> It performs the tasks for Weight process
 		
 		> boarding_pass :
 			--> BOARDING_PASS.h ==> It performs the tasks for Boarding Pass process
 			
 		> passengers :
 			It contains all the newly created Boarding Pass files for the passengers.
 	
2) immigration : It has the file immigration.c for the 'Immigration' process. It has the following files :
	- PASSPORT.h ==> To check if a passenger's Passport is valid or not.
	- VISA.h	 ==> To check if a passenger's VISA is valid or not.
	- DATE_CHECK.h ==> It has a function to compare two string format dates. It returns 1 if the first date is earlier than
						the second. Else it returns -1.
						
3) security_check : It has the file security.c for the 'Security Check' process. It has the following files :
	- SECURITY_M.h ==> To check for dangerous contents in handbag for MALES.
	- SECURITY_F.h ==> To check for dangerous contents in handbag for FEMALES.
	- SEC_HEADER.h ==> It has the functions to check if a given number is prime, colorful or palindrome. It also has the 
						functions to search and delete elements from the handbad.
						
4) wait_lounge : It has the file  wait_lounge.c for the 'Waiting Lounge ' process. It has the following files :
	- CAFE.h ==> It is executed when a user is to be sent to Cafe.
	- RESTROOM.h ==> It is executed when a user is to be sent to Restroom.
	
5) board_pass : It has the file  board_pass.c for the 'Boarding Pass' process before departure.

HOW TO EXECUTE MY PROGRAM ?

Simply in the "mega" folder, or the outer most folder, type 'make'
This will compile the process and create and executable named 'airport'

Now type './airport' to execute the program.

The necessary information is displayed on the terminal. 
The Boarding Passes of the users can be checked in the "./baggage/passengers/" folder

To clean all the files created by the program type "make clean" on the terminal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRUCTURE :

My program follows a structure as expected in the question. The airport(main) process first forks all the child processes,
which fork their sub-processes. The first command all of these processes execute is 'kill(getpid(),SIGSTOP)'

Thus every process is stopped and the airport can now send the first passenger to 'baggage'.

The rest of the signaling is carried out as explained in the question.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT I COULDN't DO :

I couldn't properly sychronize passengers going into the restroom and the cafe at their own will continuously.
At present, every passenger either goes to Cafe or Restroom, but does not cycle through them as expected.

REASON :

I genuinely fell short of time as I had the (successful)Microsoft interviews for Summer Internship and my entire 2 days were wasted.
I would've tried to implement a while loop inside the Waiting Lounge to move the passengers to and fro.
